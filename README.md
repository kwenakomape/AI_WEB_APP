# AI_WEB_APP
In this project I will design and implement a web-based application to explore and navigate the Artificial Intelligence 
research community in South Africa. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a complex and dynamic discipline with many different 
topics and sub-areas. This makes it difficult to gauge the nature, size and impact of the AI research community in 
South Africa. AI researchers are based at South Africaâ€™s 26 public universities and other research-based organisations.
They publish the results of their research in a variety of venues, including journals, conference proceedings and workshop
proceedings. The application will draw from and consolidate data from multiple public research data sources, including the 
researcher rating system used by the National Research Foundation (NRF) and Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG). A web based 
interface must be provided for users to perform queries and visualise information about the research community 
including: a) dominant research areas/topics, publications venues, collaborations (co-authors) and impact (citations) (b) 
the institution and region in which researchers are based (c) finding interesting trends and patterns over time, (c) 
appropriate metrics to assess and analyse the community and network structure, 
and (d) manual update and synchronisation functionality with MAG, the NRF and other public data sources
